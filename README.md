# Three-point-Shot-Progression-Since-Stephen-Curry-was-Drafted
This project analyses the evolution of three-point shooting in the NBA since Stephen Curry’s draft in 2010. By examining play-by-play data from NBA games between 1999 and 2023 and team win-loss records, I explored trends at the individual, team, and league levels. Using Python and data visualisation libraries, I assessed how three-point attempts and successes have changed over time and the extent of Curry’s influence on these trends.

The findings suggest that while the three-point shot was already gaining prominence before 2010, Stephen Curry’s exceptional performance and the success of the Golden State Warriors accelerated its adoption across the league. There has been a significant increase in three-point attempts and a shift in offensive strategies, with teams prioritizing three-pointers and close-range shots over mid-range attempts. This study provides a data-driven perspective on how Curry has shaped modern NBA gameplay.
